Auth 
- No need server-side rendering if search engine doesn't need to see tht content 
--> Render on client / Set up an API route 

- Use useContext to store auth info 

- useAuthState listen to current user in firebase 
--> vs. onAuthStateChanged(): needs a user obj 

- Reverse mapping validating uniqueness: 
  User contains username field, photo field, displayName field 
  Username contains only 1 uid field 

SSR
- SSR getServerSideProps(): fetch data on server for every request, prevent render until server is available --> Slower
- SSG getStaticProps(): fetch data in advance in build-time --> Fast bt hv to redeploy entire site to hv new data 
- ISR revalidate: regenerate page when new request come in for a certain interval
